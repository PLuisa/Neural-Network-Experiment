Data Mining Project

Overview

This project implements various data mining techniques, including clustering, neural networks, association rule mining, and weighted nearest neighbor classification. The goal is to analyze datasets and extract meaningful patterns using different machine learning methods.

Implemented Algorithms

🔹 1. K-Means Clustering
kmeans1.py: First approach to K-Means clustering.
kmeans2.py: Second approach to K-Means clustering.
Description: K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data into clusters based on similarity.

🔹 2. Neural Networks
neural_network.py: Trains a neural network (NN1) for classification.
nn1_validate.py: Validates NN1 using test data.
nn2.py: Implements a different neural network architecture.
Description: Neural networks are used for predictive modeling and classification tasks.

🔹 3. Association Rule Mining
basket_analysis.py: Implements market basket analysis to discover associations between items.
Description: This technique is widely used in retail to identify frequently co-occurring items.

🔹 4. Weighted Nearest Neighbor (WNN)
weighted_nn.py: Implements a weighted version of the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
Description: WNN assigns different weights to neighbors based on their distances, improving classification performance.
